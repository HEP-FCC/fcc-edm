Modifying the existing EDM
==

This document explains how to adapt the FCC-EDM to changing needs. As mentioned in other documents, the data-model is generated from the description in the [edm.yaml](https://github.com/HEP-FCC/fcc-edm/blob/master/edm.yaml). 

DO NOT change code in the `datamodel` directory.

Refer to PODIO for documentation on the available feature set in the [syntax description](https://github.com/HEP-FCC/podio/blob/master/doc/datamodel_syntax.md).
